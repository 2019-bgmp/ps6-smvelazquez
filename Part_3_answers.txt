1. Describe how the assembly changes with different k-mer values using the assembly
statistics you have collected. How does the contig length distribution change?
  Answer: As the k-mer values increase, the total length of the assembly decreases. This results in a shift to the right for the contig length distribution
  showing more contigs with higher values than shorter values.
2. How does an increased coverage cutoff affect the assembly? What is happening to the
de Bruijin graph when you change the value of this parameter? How does velvet
calculate its value for ‘auto’?
  Answer: As the coverage cutoff increases, the distribution of lengths shifts to the right.
  The de bruijn graphs get smaller every time since you're limiting the number of errors you can contain in your graphs.
  Velvet calculates the coverage cutoff as half of its calculated expected coverage.
3. How does increasing minimum contig length affect your contig length distribution and
N50?
  Answer: Increasing the minimum contig length shifts the distribution significantly further outright.
  It also lowers your N50 value since you have significantly fewer contigs to work with.
